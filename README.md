# Welcome to MathUtill
### This is a small Java project where I practiced the core concepts of Software Testing and CI/CD. Instead of focusing on complex business logic, I focused on building a testing environment.

### You will find in this repo the following stuff:

* A unit testing source code using JUnit testing Framwork
* A TDD, DDT source code
* A CI (Continuos Intergration) script
* And more...
